## Attribution

This project is inspired by the natural beauty of the Aurora Borealis and aims to make
aurora science accessible to everyone. While the software is provided under the MIT
license, we encourage users to:

- Share knowledge about aurora science and space weather
- Contribute to citizen science projects
- Support dark sky preservation efforts
- Promote educational outreach about natural phenomena

## Third-Party Acknowledgments

This project uses simulated data for educational purposes. For real-time aurora
forecasting, we recommend consulting:

- NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/)
- Aurora Service Europe (https://www.aurora-service.eu/)
- SpaceWeatherLive (https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/)
- Various aurora forecasting mobile applications

## Scientific References

Aurora predictions are based on established scientific principles:
- Geomagnetic field interactions with solar wind
- KP index correlations with aurora visibility
- Magnetic latitude calculations for viewing probabilities
- Historical aurora occurrence patterns
